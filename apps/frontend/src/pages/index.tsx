            <Typography paragraph>
              My name is Alex Bechmann, a 27 year old full-stack web developer
              from Silkeborg. I grew up in Suffolk, United Kingdom and moved to
              Denmark in 2010 to study for a Bachelor degree in Web Development.

            <Typography paragraph>
              I have a passion for writing clean, easily understood and well
              architectured code on both front and back-end environments. I work
              hard to keep up to date with industry trends, and continuously
              look for ways to improve my skills as a developer.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              I am equally comfortable collaborating with others in a team, as I
              am working solo on projects.
            </Typography>
            <Typography paragraph>
              My native language is English, and I also speak Danish fluently.

            <Typography paragraph>
              Outside of work I love to swim, play music, learn new coding
              skills by working on side projects & spend time with my family!
